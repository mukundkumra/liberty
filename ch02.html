      <div class="content">
        <p>X.02 - Xavi</p>
      <p>I wiped the tears off my face and composed myself. Imagine a boy my age crying like a baby over something like this, good grief.</p>
      <p>I came out of the shower and wore my clothes after drying off. The clothes aren't anything fancy, rather it's a typical plain white outfit, cliché lab rat attire, huh.</p>
      <p>I wore my clothes and stood infront of the mirror, just gazing at it - a boy of hispanic origin looked back at me with his amber eyes. He had black hair and a dark complexion. Not overly handsome, not unattractive either. Sometimes the guy in the mirror seems like a stranger to me.</p>
      <p>[Sighs]</p>
      <p>Geez, I got lost in thought again. Alex is probably still inside, he's really typical about hygiene and spends a lot of time in the bath. Now then there's still some time left for breakfast, should I work out for a bit, hmm.</p>
      <p>"Hey Xavi, wanna train with me" , a familar voice called out.</p>
      <p>"Shoots!?"</p>
      <p>"It's Schutz, you dimwit, how many times should I repeat myself??" he yelled.</p>
      <p>"Sorry, my bad. It's kinda confusing."</p>
      <p>He sighed and said "Fine. I give up. Call me whatever you want. Shoots is great"</p>
      <p>Wow, being saracstic now are we? Mustve really got on his nerves, this early in the morning too ugh.</p>
      <p>"Anyway, let's scram to The Yard. Tsubasa got up late and just went to bath so it'll only be the two of us."</p>
      <p>"Fine, works for me." I agreed.</p>
      <p>So let me introduce you to this guy. His name is Schutz Freiheit(pronounced faa-ey-haa-eyt). He's a couple of years older than me and the longest survivor of this place, his number is 2 so he's also one of the first ones to come here. His appearance is that of a tall caucasian boy with brown hair and a solid build. If I had to describe him in few words, I'd say he's a big muscular dude who's like a big brother to everyone here. He shares his room with Tsubasa Kurosaki(No.3), another long-timer, you'll get to know more about him later on. Well, enough about them for now, let's get on with my day.</p>
      <p> a few minutes later...</p>
      <p>"Thanks for helping out, Xavi, it's always better to work out with a partner"</p>
      <p>"Don't sweat it. I'd feel bad if fitness freaks like you couldnt follow through with your passion"</p>
      <p>"Hahah youve got my grattitude. Well then, I better catch up with Tsubasa. Mind if we catch up later?"</p>
      <p>"Sure thing. Ill go and have something to eat, see you then" and we departed.</p>
      <p>I caught up with Alex on my way to our room. Shortly after we reached our room, breakfast was delivered to us. It had steamed potatoes, vegetables, boiled eggs and a slice of bread.</p>
      <p>After consuming the meal we went to the library since it's our free time. The Blonde just reads up on The Xenarthians believing it'll help in the future with his 'Vengeance' or somethin' like that. I believe it's of no use though, since he could be spending this precious time on better things.</p>
      <p>Let's see now, what should I study today, hmm. There’s Anatomy and Physiology, Introduction to Organic Chemistry, Principles of Gravity... wait a sec, I know, Geography sounds like a pretty good choice.</p>

        <p>'Changes in Our World over The years, Vol. 1'</p>
        <p>'Due to stray debris from asteroids and man-made observational objects called satellites colliding with each other in Earth's atmosphere and getting trapped inside the planet's gravitational field, 2 new moons(Artemis and Tsukuyomi, named after moon dieties from different mythologies) have emerged. This has lead to exceptionally volatile tidal currents, making voyage into the sea inconcievable.'</p>
        <p>'The rise of water level has also lead to the loss of a natural marvel of The Earth, The Great Barrier Reef. Our planet's most virtually diverse ecosystem is now inacessable to human life. The Reef was once home to over 1700 species of aquatic fauna.'</p>
        <p>'On another note, a major part of Australia which was uninhabitable earlier due to receiving little rain and inability to grow vegetation in over 35% of the region benefitted from the rise in sea level and change in climate. Africa however, did not receive the same fortune as the excess of salinity in the soil resulting from the risen water level led to a further decline in plant life on  the continent.''</p>
        <p>Tch. It's a shame, I wanted to go out at sea once I got out of this hellhole, well, IF I ever did. Now that's out of the question. I tell you, this place is hell-bent on breaking us. The facilities aside, it's basically a giant jail cell. These books are the only things that keep me going on, providing knowledge and information on the wonders of our vast world, how else is a guy trapped inside a building for eternity knowing death's coming for him any time keep sane [cough][cough]. Even if there's an astronomically slim chance I make it to adulthood, I'll still become Alien Cuisine, it's kinda depressing really.</p>
        <p>But whatever happens, I wont be a coward like them, I won't quit. I'll keep on living even if it kills me on the inside. I'll live through this and I'll win my freedom one day, hopefully.</p>
