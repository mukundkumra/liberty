    <h2>Prologue</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>An advanced society located many lightyears away from the galaxy we call Milky Way, lived on a planet called [Xenartha - a planet with a landmass equivalent to than that of Argentina]. They had evolved to a state where they had transcended the necessity to communicate with language and could relay their thoughts and emotions through invisible signals, what we call telepathy. They were gigantic in size yet these masses were swifter than you could imagine. They had practically reached the peak of evolution. The only thing going wrong for them was that their planet was in peril. Over the millenniums, they had exhausted their natural resources and the planet was all but rotten down to its core. In order to survive, their only hope was to venture into space in order to search for a new land, one where their kind could survive. The majority of the populus(257,000) left in search of a different place to inhabit while a faction(16,000) stayed behind in order to preserve their dwelling.</p>
      <p>While on their journey, they detected a planet much larger than theirs - one with a majority of it submerged in waterbodies. This was a planet known to us by the name of Earth. At this point of time, the majority of the planet had become uninhabitable leave a somewhat large landmass where the remnants of the race known as humans lived. Earth had suffered through the years with natural disasters and humanity’s abuse of the environment leaving the planet in a sorry state. The only exception was a landmass that was previously untouched by humans as it was mostly barren and uninhabitable to begin with but over time due to a change in climate became a haven for the residual lifeforms inhabiting Earth, the land called New Australia.</p>
      <p>At first when they landed on this planet the Aliens tried to live in a pacifistic way, enjoying the natural resources of this planet that theirs no longer had. They supressed their presence by hiding their gigantic ship beneath the vast waterbodies surrounding the landmass, only coming out once in a while in order to gather nutrition for themselves and tried not to meddle with the affairs of this planet. Unlike humans, The Aliens digested food much more effeciently, storing it and breaking each nutrient down as and when needed. Their biology was such which even allowed them to digest and utilize fibres, urea and other such salts which we are required to excrete. The Aliens gathered gravel and stones and consumed many types of rocks which were rich in iron, magnesium, potassium, sulphur, etc. found commonly on the surface, and due to their efficent digestive systems were able to go many weeks without food, yet this was not a sustainable lifestyle for The Aliens and started to take its toll on them with many dying malnourished(102).</p>
      <p>One day, they saw a human hunting down a beast, and experienced something they had never even imagined before, a living creature consuming another living creature. This made them imagine of a posibility of consuming humans and other such lifeforms inhabiting Earth for their own survival. Shortly after, they kidnapped a human passing by the shore. They disected it and experimented on it. Upon inspection it was found out that the composition of humans was ideal to become a staple meal of The Aliens, having the right balance of minerals and salts required for their sustainance.</p>
      <p>Seeing no other choice for their own survival and the advantages of consuming humans, the Aliens decided to breed humans for consumption (like humans breed chickens and other such livestock) and eat them for their survival. This lead to human retaliation and a war between the reigning World Government and The Aliens. The war had devastating effects with Aliens being at a huge advantage due to their supreme genes however humanity had nuclear weapons which were somehow effective against the Aliens. Seeing no other way out of this adversity due to a deficit of nuclear firepower and lack of other countermeasures, fearing the complete annihalation and extinction of the human race, The President of The World Government that ruled over New Australia proposed an idea to the Aliens. The humans would submit themselves to be consumed by The Aliens but The Aliens would not not lay their hands on any children(identified as humans below the age of 21) or any government official. The aliens accepted because they did not want any unnecessary bloodshed and were themselves fighting for the sake of their own survival. And so a hundred years passed and Earth had a new entity at the top of it’s food chain.</p>
