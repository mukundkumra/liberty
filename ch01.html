  <h1>LIBERTY</h1>
  <h4 class="byline">by Mukund Kumra</h4>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I was sound asleep when a buzzing sound broke my slumber. As I rubbed my eyes, I cursed those assholes for waking us up so early. I looked up and found myself in this plain room of pure white, a room so small it suffocated me, well maybe I'm overexaggerating. I arose from my bed, it's a bunk I share with a dude who's a couple years younger than me. I sleep in the upper one. I jumped off the bunk and landed on the floor.</p>

  <p>I glance at the blondie and he was still sound asleep. I leaned over to his ear - "Rise and Shine, Mr. Prince" I said in a loud voice. He opened his eyes real fast, saw my face then shut 'em back down, turned to the other side and started snoring again. This bastard...</p>

  <p>"Fine then, don't come crying to me when they don't give you meals for misbehaving cause I ain't sharing mine" I yelled while turning towards the door. He jumped on his feet before I even took another step.</p>

  <p>"Fine, fine, see I'm up and running". Yeah well, good for you, it's not like I wanted to get up so early myself. We left the room and assembled in the reporting area.</p>

    <p>"No. 23" The woman in the lab coat stated, "Yes Ma'am", I answered. Me and 'His Highness' got our daily check-up then went to clean up in the Bath. Since we beat the others to the race, the bath was empty. I did my business and then went to take a shower.</p>

    <p>As I was about to enter, I got a glimpse of blondie who was going to enter the shower next door himself, I observed he isn't nearly as nasty as the day he came in, rather I even catch him smiling and laughing sometimes. I'm glad he's all cheerful now. A couple of months ago, he was filled with rage and had this bloodlust in his eyes, he's got a pair of crimson ones so it seemed all the more scary. He wouldnt listen to anyone and was insubordinate. He was repeatedly screaming and cursing things like "I'll get you back you sons of bitches, I'll get you back". Well, I wouldn't blame him especially after what he went through.
    </p>

    <p>Actually I remember that day quite vividly...</p>

    <p>A kid with shoulder-length blonde hair and crimson eyes who looked no older than 8 was dragged in by the guards, while screaming and cursing. Wouldn't shut up nor stop resisting. He kept at it for more than a week, he was so rebellious they kept him isolated and didnt give him food. He was persistent though, I'll give him that. Yet even his spirit broke within a week. He stopped complaining and shouting and just had this grim expression on his face, like he was dead inside. They transferred him to my room after he was cleared from isolation. He gave a whole 'don't-bother-me-vibe' so I didnt come near him to introduce myself or anything like that. The same night as I lay in bed I heard sobbing from the bunk below me. It wasnt very audible since he was trying to hide it but it still bothered me. I said enough is enough and went over. Tried to speak to him, he bawled at me and told me to get lost. It kinda pissed me off to be honest so I grabbed the bedsheet he was all wrapped up in and threw him out his bunk.</p>

    <p>"See I don't know you and I don't know what your deal is but you can't keep this going, okay? The way you are, you won't last a month here. Nobody wants to be here, y'know. We're forced to be here, being lab rats for the same damn regime that's supposed to ensure our safety, not knowing if we'll live another day. All we guys have over here is each other, if we won't open up and support each other, forget our bodies, our minds will break from this bondage and we'll never be free".</p>

    <p>After hearing me he calmed down a bit and wiped his face with his shirt.</p>

    <p>"Now I'll introduce myself, They call me No. 23 in here tho the name's Xavier(pronounced haa-vee-err), you can call me Xavi. I don't remember my last name, neither much of my life before I came here. Im around 10. Been here 5 years. Now what's your story?".</p>

    <p>He spoke "I'm Alex." he stated and shut his mouth again.</p>

    <p>"And? Hey, I asked what's your story, we aren't going anywhere with this. It's fine, if you want to, you can keep to yourself but since we'll be roommates I'd like it if we knew more about each other. I mean trust me, open up a little, you'll feel better too"</p>

    <p>" 'Kay Fine. My full name is Alex van Garde, I'm nearly 8 years old. My family used to rule over New Australia alongside the government before those bastards from space landed here a century ago. When the government decided to practically sell humanity out in order to save their own asses, my ancestor Elwin van Garde who was the reigning king of New Australia refused to make our family a part of the treaty and decided to fight till the end and not give in to those monsters. The van Gardes had plenty of resources and underground hideouts and facilities with access to food, water, ammunition, nuclear weapons amongst other things, so we've practically lived in the netherworld all this time fighing for humanity's sake while the government is out there being their lapdogs. Well I dont know if you'd believe me but its what my parents always used to tell me. I dont have any proof for what I said, just my word."</p>

    <p>"No, I believe you, you wouldnt have a motive for concocting up such a thorough story, especially after I made you speak even though you weren't really all that keen to converse, I'd be an asshole not to believe you. Well, you sure do know a lot of stuff for an 8 year old."</p>

  <p>"Speak for yourself, you pretty much act like a grown-up already, besides in this day and age it's not like we get time to be kids or anything"</p>

  <p>"The world's pretty messed up, huh. So a royal, eh, how'd you land up in here?""</p>

    <p>"3 weeks earlier, we were residing near a mine site in Canberra when we were ambushed by 2 Aliens.", he took a deep breath then continued "Dad and Mom were killed by those monsters and sent to a breeding farm while the government claimed me up and sent me here. Since Mom, Dad and I were the only ones left in my family it's practically the end of The Van Gardes." an awkward silence then came about.

      <p>"So anyway, what even is this place? and what did you mean earlier when you said you don't know if you'll live another day?" he said, breaking the ice.</p>

    <p>"This is a testing facility where the government sends orphans and unaccounted children land up in. Well it's kinda like their own personal playground. They bring children here, subject them to Alien DNA and observe the changes in their body. You never know how much of a dose you'll get, when they'll experiment on you, is it placebo or the real deal? Will you live to see tomorrow?"</p>

    <p>"How did they manage to get a hold of Alien DNA? And how do you know so much about whatever's going on in here?"</p>

    <p>"I'm in the dark on how they got their hands on Alien DNA but the rest of it isn't really a secret. Everybody knows what's going on here. The labcoats tell us about it from time to time 'cause well they dont see any point in hiding it since they know we can't really do anything. The security here is too tight to make an escape and even if we do run away, it'll be really hard to survive without any arrangements for food and water especially since the government's regulated everything and share it with those space freaks. Plus you resist too hard they'll drug you, starve you, isolate you, abuse you and make things a whole lot worse, I mean atleast right now we can read books, eat good food, drink clean water and talk to each other for support."</p>

    <p>He went silent for a while and processed all the information I told him.</p>

    <p>"You sure do make some good points, Xavi was it? Well I guess that's enough conversation for today, I'll go to sleep now since I'm really mentally and physically drained. Thanks for the pep talk. Night."</p>

    <p>"Good Night to you aswell, Your Highness" I said jokingly.</p>

    <p>"Shut it" he replied as he picked up his sheet and went to bed.</p>

    <p>[Hey Alex, I wish atleast you can outlast me, you will, won't you? I've lost 3 roommates now, I can't take it anymore. Promise me Alex, promise you'll get out of here. Hey, Blondie, promise me you'll survive no matter what it takes, you will, right? You have to.] - I couldn't sleep that night as I kept muttering to myself.
    </p>

  <p>...</p>

    <p>I went inside the shower and turned the valve. As the water poured at me, I stared at the wall, fantasizing a world outside the cramped room I resided in, one where humanity is free, one where no single person shall serve under a corrupt government or get treated as meat by a bunch of extraterrestrial monsters. I wondered if I could see the blue sky once again, the one where birds fly, the creatures who are truly free, the ones who are not bound to anything, I wished to be like them, I too wished to fly. The water pouring on me blended with the tears on my face, tears that wouldnt stop flowing, tears that represented the sorrow of being opressed, tears that I could not show anyone. If Alex saw me he'd call me a hypocrite, huh? But it can't be helped, I have to set an example for everyone, I have to be strong, I said to myself, even though I felt fear, despair and helplessness. At that moment, I truly wished for Liberty.</p>
