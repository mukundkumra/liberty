  <h1>LIBERTY</h1>
  <h4 class="byline">by Mukund Kumra</h4>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>A buzzing sound broke my slumber as I rubbed my eyes. I looked up and found myself in this plain room of pure white, a room so small it suffocated me, well maybe I'm overexaggerating. I got off my bed, it's a bunk I shared with a dude couple years younger than me. I slept in the upper compartment. I jumped off and landed on the floor. I looked at the blondie and he was still sound asleep. I leaned over to his ear - "Rise and Shine, Mr. Prince" I said in a loud voice. He opened his eyes real fast, saw my face then shut them down, turned to the other side and started snoring back again. This bastard... "Fine then, don't come crying to me when they dont give you meals for not behaving cause I'm not sharing mine" I shouted while turning back. He jumped on his feet before I even took another step. "Fine, fine, see I'm up and running". Yeah well, it's not like I wanted to get up so early myself. We left the room and assembled with the others.
  </p>

  <p>"No. 23" The woman in the lab coat stated, "Yes Maam", I answered. Me and 'His Highness' reported and then went to clean up in the Bath. I did my business and then went to take a shower.</p>

  <p>As I was about to enter, I glanced over at blondie who was going to enter the shower next, noticed he isn't nearly as bad as the day he came in, rather I even catch him smiling and laughing sometimes. I'm glad he's cheerful now. A couple of months ago, he was filled with rage and had this bloodlust in his eyes, he's got a pair of crimson ones so it seemed all the more scary. He wouldnt listen to anyone and was insuboordinate. He was repeatedldy screaming and cursing things like "I'll get you back you sons of bitches, I'll get you back". Well, I wouldn't blame him especially after what he went through.</p>

  <p>I remember that day quite vividly...</p>

  <p>A kid with shoulder-length blonde hair and crimson eyes who looked no older than 8 was dragged in by the guards, while screaming and cursing. Wouldn't shut up nor stop resisting. He kept at it for more than a week, he was so rebellious they kept him isolated and didnt give him food. He was persistant I'll give him that. Yet even his spirit broke within a week. He stopped complaining and shouting and just had a grim expression on his face. They transferred him to my room after he was cleared from isolation. When I saw him he seemed a bit dead inside. He gave a whole 'don't-bother-me-vibe' so I didnt come near him to introduce myself and things like that. The same night as I lay in bed I heard sobbing from the bunk below me. It wasnt a very audible sound since he was trying to hide it. I said enough is enough and went over. Tried to talk to him, he shouted and told me to go away. I grabbed him by his sheet and threw him out the bed - </p>

  <p>"See I don't know you and I don't know what your deal is but you can't keep this going. The way you are you won't last a month here. Nobody wants to be here, y'know. We're forced to be here in this testing facility, being experimented on by the same damn government that's supposed to ensure our safety, not knowing if we'll live another day. All we have over here is each other, if we won't open up and support each other, forget our bodies our, minds will break from this bondage and we'll never be free".</p>

  <p>After hearing me he calmed down a bit and wiped his face with his shirt.</p>

  <p>"Now I'll introduce myself, They call me No. 23 in here tho the name's Xavier(pronounced haa-vee-err), you can call me Xavi. I don't remember my last name, neither much of my life before I came here. Im around 10. Been here 5 years. Now what's your story?".</p>

  <p>He spoke "I'm Alex." he stated and shut his mouth back again.</p>

  <p>"And? Hey, I asked what's your story, we aren't going anywhere with this. It's fine you can keep to yourself but since we'll be sharing beds I'd like us to know each other better. I mean trust me, open up a little, you'll feel better too"</p>

  <p>"My full name is Alex van Garde, I'm nearly 8 years old. My family used to rule over New Australia alongside the government before those bastards from space landed here a century ago. When the government decided to practically sell humanity out at the cost of saving their own asses, my ancestor Elwin van Garde who was the reigning king of New Australia refused to make our family a part of the treaty and decided to fight till the end and not give in to those monsters. The van Gardes had plenty of resources and underground hideouts and facilities with access to food, water, ammunition, nuclear weapons amongst other things, so we've practically lived in the netherworld all this time fighing for humanity's sake while the government is out there being their lapdogs. Well I dont know if you'd believe me, its what my parents always used to tell me, I dont have any proof for what I said, just my word."</p>

  <p>"No, I believe you, you wouldnt have a motive for concocting up such a thorough story, especially after I made you speak even though you weren't really all that keen to converse, I'd be an asshole not to believe you. So a royal, huh? So how'd you land up in here?"</p>

  <p>"Dad, Mom and I were the only ones left in my family. 3 weeks earlier, we were residing near a mine site in Canberra when we were ambushed by 2 Aliens.", he took a breath of air then said "Dad and Mom were killed by those monsters and sent to a breeding farm while the government claimed me up and sent me here. What even is this place? and what did you mean earlier when you said you don't know if you'll live another day?"</p>

  <p>"This is a testing facility where orphans and unaccounted children land up in. Well it's kinda like their own personal playground. They bring children here subject them to Alien DNA and observe the changes in their body, you never know how much a dose you'll get, when they'll experiment on you, is it placebo or the real deal?"</p>

  <p>"How did they manage to get a hold of Alien DNA? And how do you know so much about whatever's going on in here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know how they seem to get Alien DNA but the rest isn't really a secret. Everybody knows what's going on here. The labcoats tell us about it from time to time 'cause well they dont see any point in hiding it since they know we can't do really do anything. The security here is too tight to escape and even if we run away, it'll be really hard to survive without any arrangements for food and water especially since the governments regulated everything and share it with the space freaks. Plus you resist too hard they'll drug you, starve you, isolate you, abuse you and make things a whole lot worse, I mean atleast right now we can read books, eat good food, drink clean water and talk to each other for support."</p>

  <p>He went silent for a while and processed all the information I told him.</p>

  <p>"You sure do make some good points, Xavi was it? Well I guess that's enough conversation for today, I'll go to sleep now since I'm really mentally and physically drained of stamina, thanks for the pep talk. Night."</p>

  <p>"Good Night to you aswell, Your Highness" I said jokingly.</p>

  <p>"Shut it" he said as he took back his sheet and went back to his bed.</p>

  <p>Alex, I wish atleast you can outlast me, you will won't you, I've lost 3 roommates now, I can't take it anymore. Promise me Alex, promise me you'll get to the other side of this wall. Hey, Blondie, promise me, promise you'll survive no matter what it takes, yo will, right? You have to...</p>

  <p>I then went inside the shower, as the water poured at me I stared at the wall, imagining a world outside the cramped room I resided in, one where humanity is free, one where no human shall serve under a corrupt government or treated as meat by a bunch of monsters. I wondered if I could see the blue sky once again, the one where birds fly, the creatures who are truly free, the ones who are not bound to anything. The water pouring on me blended with the tears on my face, tears that wouldnt stop flowing, tears that represented the sorrow of being opressed, tears that I could not show anyone. If Alex saw me he'd call me a hypocrite, huh? I thought, but it couldn't be helped, I had to set an example for everyone, I had to be strong, even though I felt fear, despair and helplessness. At that moment, I truly wished for Liberty.</p>
